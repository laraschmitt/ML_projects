### Data Science Projects
Repository for small data science projects I conducted (mostly from the first weeks of the SPICED Academy Data Science Program). 
The repo includes data exploration and data wrangling in Pandas, data vizualisation and the application of different Machine Learning models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, ARIMA).

#### 1. Gapminder - Visual Data Analysis with Matplotlib & Seaborn
* [gapminder dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
* EDA: data wrnagling, descriptive statistics, exploratory plots (histogram, bar plot)
* final visualization as an animated scatterplot

#### 2. Titanic dataset - Random Forest Classification
* dataset: 
* EDA:
* implementation of a Random Forest Classification model with hyperparameter optimization 
* CREATE HYPERLINK

#### 3. Bikesharing System - Regression Models
* dataset: HYPERLINK 

#### 4. Lyrics CLassifier - BOW - Naive Bayes Model 
* data  scraped from: lyrics.com
* web scraping using BeautifulSoup and Regex
* tokenizing and lemmatizing using Spacy
* transform data into a TFIDF-Vectorizer
* Naive Bayes model to predict artist based on word spectrum

#### 5. Time series analysis (Daily Temperature) - ARIMA model
* temperature data for Berlin-Tempelhof (data from:
* exploring Linear Autoregression "manually"
* ARIMA model to predict the daily mean temperature based on historical weather data
