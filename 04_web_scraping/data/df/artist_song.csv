Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready

Snakes are biting at my heels
The worries that refuse to let us go
I've been kicking them away
Been hoping not to let them take control

Ooh, I'm not ready
Drink to escape their bites
Show me distraction
Even for just one night

'Cause it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
Yes, it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
And I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me whole

Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready

Now these days are feeling dark
We're struggling to figure out last year
When the woman on the news keeps saying things that no one wants to hear

Ooh, I'm not ready
Drink to escape our minds
Show me distraction
Even for just one night

'Cause it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
Yes, it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
And I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me whole 
Yes, I pray for the ground to swallow me whole

Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready

""Come on, boys. Let's go tear this place apart!""

'Cause I know, 'cause I know life is simple when
I can just ignore it all
'Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know
Life is simple when
I can just ignore it all
'Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know

If I'm not ready
Snakes will consume me whole
If I'm not steady
Baby they'll take control

But it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
Yes, it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me whole
Yes, I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me whole"

Ignore the stink of burning leather
'Cause you're young and right down
Radio sings, cool life forever
And depending on the weather, you'll be there
Your shadow tall, you lean against the wall
Waiting on the call
Waiting on the call that will set it out

At the top of the hour, meet me at Cappuccino City
Roaches climbing the wall, coffee is cold
Service is shitty, in neon light you look so pretty
As you say
Your race is run, no longer having fun
You're not the only one
Not the only one with short memory
You're not the only one with short memory

You hear the thump beating down low

And your hollow hand on a cold can
You're rising like a stone
I heard the warning, I saw you falling
Down along Sydney Road
Be alright, put your weight
On the second hand

Back in the headlights
Windows were screening one by one
A moving image of your reflection
You hardly look sharp, your guts are in a knot
And all your new friends are frayed at the ends

When your heart aches and your morning breaks
By the TV on your own

Just bodies that collide, lost and found each other

And it scares you being alone

Your mother warned of strangers and the dangers they may bring
Your dreams and memories are blurring into one
The scenes which hold the waking world slowly come undone

My dear, my dear, my dear.

With your head
Upon my shoulder
When you're in my arms
But you've gone somewhere deeper

Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to age without mistakes
Are you going to age with grace?
Or only to wake and hide your face
Well, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can

When you play it harder
And I try to follow you there
It's not about control
But I turn back when I see where you go

Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?

Is calling out your name
You always take it further

40,rolling blackouts coastal fever,"I heard you talking
Your voice had an old melody
Like sweet river water
Back from the bathroom
Moon in your hair
Late revival
It was a short walk home

I take my time
I check my sides
My head revolving
My soul divides
My feet collide
I want to make amends

My sense was off
My knees were rolled
My eyes were sweaty
My arms were heavy
I reappeared, except a faded song
A vision of a real thing

You take a high wire jump
You feel time dripping away
Falling in the burning room
You feel time dripping away

And I wait for the moment to come
And I watch all the minutes run

I take my time
My head revolving
A second chance
A deviation

You take a high wire jump
You feel time dripping away
Falling in the burning room
You feel time dripping away

I put myself in a letter
I send myself on the power lines
A picture of yourself in the future
And nation in the plains
Beyond the frames
Two figurines on the melter
You find yourself, again, on holiday
I feel it in my brain
Do you feel the same?
I can't be ignored on video

You take a high wire jump
You feel time dripping away
Falling in the burning room
You feel time dripping away"
41,rolling blackouts coastal fever,"I heard the sound of the church at six
I fell among the cooling bricks
All the tall trees were still lining the avenue
Hanging there like old friends do, bystanding quietly

Had the game lost its spark?
Evening star, right on cue

Still in a solid state
Still in a solid state for so long
Night train passing over
And the sound kept on ringing 'round

I went the long way, I would be vindicated

I kept my head down, two eyes on the paving
Caught in a necktie, a lifestyle in single file
A river of brake lights to opposite lifts
And opposite lofts

Still in a solid state
Still in a solid state for so long
Night train passing over
And the sound kept on ringing round

World A.D.
You walk past the wall you first kissed her against
How could you forget?
While the sirens howled and the wind caressed
Under jacaranda, beneath the burnt-out moon
Or was it over there?
Did it ever matter in the first place?
Does she still think about it now and then?
In her air conditioned home
On her air conditioned street
In an air conditioned city"

And woah the air is on fire
This room feels electric, cord here in your sights

Power, power
I will never understand the power you're holding over me
Power, power
Oh you've had it too long, yes you've had it too long

Pain, just synapses firing in our brain
So when you cut me, cut me deep
Hurt the ones you love the most easily

Are you back again
I can hear your rings on the pavement
Nice to see you keep up appearances
But must you beg so hard on my basement

All your plants are dead
Balance in the red
But you always paid your way
Fair enough to say
How

After Collingwood
Saw you as you were
Shot for Hollywood
Draped in dirty fur
This town was not big enough
For the one of you
Doors were to narrow
And the chill wind blew

Felt it in your bones
Roll away the stone
You lose again in the northern island

But when you lay me down sweet and slow
My heart won't fight it
Stone cold
Flying like a hawk
Skywards

In the city of dreamers
There were so many like you
Snowflakes melted in the perma-sun
Bands on the run
It was warm at night
But cold inside you

Though it never rained
Sometimes hurricane
With you in the eye of them
They'd always spare your head

But when you lay me down sweet and slow
My heart won't fight it
Stone cold
Flying like a hawk
Skywards

Called you the cool change
'Cause when you darkened the doorway
Someone's life was about to get clouded
But not me though
I was the one who thought that
Sunshine from your eyes
When you smiled
You were the chosen boy
And you chose to ride the wind

But when you lay me down sweet and slow
My heart won't fight it
Stone cold
Flying like a hawk
Skywards"

Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you, just like a child, girl

You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
Because I never wanna see you sad, girl
Don't be a bad girl

Bouncing out the door
Goosebumps on your skin

Your hair stands up
When I kiss the back of your neck
Been driving 'cross the country
Just to see those wide eyes

Wide eyes

When I hit South Dowling St
I know where I am
I have a fortunate life
Gonna see what I can
One in every port
You know that's not who I am
You'll never see your kitchen floor
The same way again
With those wide eyes

River run
I will run to you
Seven years, you let love in
And you will come to me
Never let this cowboy ride
The only one is right
For your eyes

I found the jewel
Deep in a swimming pool
I knew what I was lacking
So I threw it back in
Now I drive the ring roads
Sing my song
Suspended in the air
I could be anywhere

New seasons frosted
River run
I will run to you
Seven years, you let love in

Calling for hours
Easy on the sand
Hard in the showers
Scuff my blinded shoes
Smoke up in the alley

In the gray concrete yard

Gaze down at the stinking streets

The only one in sight

Your tongue moves like a shining sword
In your suit of armour, powder blue
You're running with the wild ones
And the boys always get up to no good
It's different when they're not around
Long lunches go down slowly
With no one to massage your neck
The black cloud descends

You watch yourself on the news, don't let the feeling die
You watch yourself on the news, phone rings
Take the ticket
Take the ticket

Here's to you, looking at you
Looking at you, looking at you

You watch yourself on the news, don't let the feeling die

Velvet carpet draped under shining candlelight
Oil portraits hang, enter the mahogany room
Behind the black rope lies the golden box

There's fire in the west, I never did my best"
101,rolling blackouts coastal fever,"Saw the warning sign outside St Anne
And the words were falling down
All the days melt into oblivion
In the time folded between the two years

And the news at ten don't change my head
And the fam don't make much sense
And you walked in from the bewilderness
With a look right through my windowpane

And I feel outside it
Lost on descent
Like two transplanted palms
You look like me

Swimming in my head
Ringing in my heart

Nothing is the same
The street hasn't changed
There's a light feeling in the back of my head
And my mind's somersaulting
I've gone out of myself
As if I'm lying in a cloud
And way down there below me
Is the body I used to have

Nothing is the same
The street hasn't changed
There's a light feeling in the back of my head
And my mind's somersaulting
I've gone out of myself
As if I'm lying in a cloud
And way down there below me
Is the body I used to have

Nothing is the same
The street hasn't changed
There's a light feeling in the back of my head
And my mind's somersaulting
I've gone out of myself
As if I'm lying in a cloud
And way down there below me
Is the body I used to have

And I feel outside it
Lost on descent
Like two transplanted palms
You look like me

Swimming in my head
Ringing in my heart

You draw a straight line to the branches
You feel the gold light coming through"
102,bastille ,"I can feel your eyes in the back of my head
Burning, burning, burning
Floating through the room as the hairs on my arms are
Rising, rising, rising
I'm chemically drawn closer to you
Eyes wide, eyes wide open
Will you be my future or just an escape?
Love me, love me, love me

You'll never get to heaven on a night like this

Those nights when your friends are gone
When you're holding on for someone to leave with
Those nights when you crave someone
To be there at dawn, to wake with, 'cause aren't we all just
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
Looking for somebody you can wake up with?
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
We are, we are

Pulling at my t-shirt, your hands everywhere
Rising, rising, rising
As you trip and fall, dragging me up the stairs
What's your, what's your name, now?

You try to get to heaven on a night like this
But you, you never get to heaven on a night like this

Those nights when your friends are gone
When you're holding on for someone to leave with
Those nights when you crave someone
To be there at dawn, to wake with, 'cause aren't we all just
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
Looking for somebody you can wake up with?
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
We are, we are

The lights, the lights, the lights
They cut a path across the room
The lights, the lights, the lights
A blinding look from me to you
And I'll be your rabbit in the headlights
We'll never get to heaven
I'll be your rabbit in the headlights
We'll never get to heaven

Those nights when your friends are gone
When you're holding on for someone to leave with
Those nights when you crave someone
To be there at dawn, to wake with, 'cause aren't we all just
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
Looking for somebody you can wake up with?
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
We are, we are

Yeah, yeah
From my brain"
103,bastille ,"I'm the lesser of two evils
Or am I, am I tricking myself nice?
Oh, I'll bring you flowers
Oh, yeah, eh yeah yeah, ah

I'll bring you flowers in the pouring rain
Living without you is driving me insane
I'll bring you flowers, I'll make your day
The tears you cry, I'll dry them all away

From the day until the day we throw it all away
Let's talk about it 'cause I cannot live without it
Your love, it means so much to me
Can't you see? Right here, I'll always be

Oh, by the way
Did I say, oh, how you're made to stay?
Right here beside you, I will never deny you
My love, you are everything to me
Can't you see? I will give to you unselfishly

Because I need you so (oh, baby)
And I will never, ever let you go

I'll bring you flowers in the pouring rain
Living without you is driving me insane
I'll bring you flowers, I'll make your day
The tears you cry, I'll dry them all away

By the way, did I say? Oh (Oh, baby)
By the way, did I say? Oh (Oh, baby)
Yeah, and if one day, you went away, I'd feel so lonely inside
I can't deny that I would break down and cry
Yeah, and all those flowers, they would wilt in the rain
It would cause me misery, pain

Because I need you so (I need you, babe)
And I will never, ever let you go (I'll never let you go)

I'll bring you flowers (I'll bring you flowers)
In the pouring rain (Oh)
Living without you (Is driving me)
Is driving me insane (Is driving me insane)
I'll bring you flowers (Bring you flowers)
I'll make your day (I'll make your day)
The tears you cry (The tears you cry)
I'll dry them all away

Oh, by the way, did I say? Oh (Oh, call me, baby)
By the way, did I say? Oh (Oh, tear me down)
Oh, call me, baby
Oh, tear me down (Oh)"
104,bastille ,"We'll make our agreements,
About when to meet,
And I'll leave you in the doorway,
The cold evening aches,
As it leaves in its wake,
All the memories left by the day,
And I'm questioning why,
As you look to the sky,
That it's cloudless up above our heads,
And thoughts come to mind,
that our short little lives,
Haven't left the path that they will tread,
They will tread

I come back to haunt you,
Memories will taunt you,
And I will try to love you,
It's not like I'm above you,

The wisdom we learn as our minds,
They do burn'll,
Entice the naivety in youth,
As adults will grow and maturity shows,
The terrifying rarity of truth,
As you turn to your mind,
And your thoughts they rewind,
To old happenings and things that are done,
You can't find what's passed,
Make that happiness last,
Seeing from those eyes what you become,
Well you become

I come back to haunt you,
Memories will taunt you,
And I will try to love you,
It's not like I'm above you,

I will see you there,
See you there,
See you there,
I'll come back to haunt,
Memories will taunt you,
And I will try to love you,
It's not like I'm above you"
105,rolling blackouts coastal fever,"All day, I listen out for Jenny's old coupe
Midnight blue, it's faded, but she's always been true
Holiday, I haven't seen you since, yeah, I had to get away
Window pane, electricity illuminates the rain

Lean your face, hopeless, no embrace
I wanna know
I wanna know where the silence comes from
Where space originates

Lay back, sink in
You're not talking straight
I'm right, this is sin
You're not talking straight
Come around, give in
You're not talking straight
Lay back, sink in
You're not talking straight

On closer inspection, it's just a reflection
And I still move with feeling inside
And it's the tyranny of questioning
Ring the diving bell
I'm further down, I'm nearly out
I'm deeper down the well

I'm hopeless, no embrace
I wanna know
I wanna know where the silence comes from
Where space originates

Lay back, sink in
You're not talking straight
I'm right, this is sin
You're not talking straight
Come around, give in
You're not talking straight
Lay back, sink in
You're not talking straight

Lay back, sink in
You're not talking straight
I'm right, this is sin
You're not talking straight
Come around, give in
You're not talking straight

In my thoughts you're far away
And you are whistling a melody, whistling a melody
Crystallizing clear as day
Oh I can picture you so easily, picture you so easily

What's gonna be left of the world if you're not in it?
What's gonna be left of the world, oh?

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

I miss you more, I miss you more
I miss you more, I miss you more
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

I miss you more

I miss you more

I miss you more

Caught off guard by your favourite song
Oh, I'll be dancing at a funeral, dancing at a funeral
Sleeping in the clothes you love
It's such a shame we had to see them burn, shame we had to see them burn

What's gonna be left of the world if you're not in it?
What's gonna be left of the world, oh?

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

I miss you more, I miss you more
I miss you more, I miss you more

107,rolling blackouts coastal fever,"I can see it in your face
I can hear it in your voice
I know you're not here for good fun
How long have you been on the run?

What are you running 
What are you running from?
What are you running 
What are you running from?
What are you running 
What are you running from?


I'm running into you
I've been running into you

What are you running

108,bastille ,"Look who's digging their own grave
That is what they all say
You'll drink yourself to death

Look who makes their own bed
Lies right down within it
And what will you have left?

Out on the front doorstep
Drinking from a paper cup
You won't remember this

Living beyond your years
Acting out all their fears
You feel it in your chest

Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
It's just begun

Standing on the cliff face
Highest foe you'll ever grace
It scares me half to death

Look out to the future
But it tells you nothing
So take another breath

Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
This is how it feels to take a fall
Icarus is flying towards an early grave

You put up your defenses when you leave
You leave because you're certain
Of who you want to be

You're putting up your armor when you leave
And you leave because you're certain
Of who you want to be, oh

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
This is how it feels to take a fall
Icarus is flying towards an early grave"

This is the question""

The animals break out their cages now
Chaos is raining down around us
But here we stand with our arms folded
Do you wanna be free of this?

When panic rises like the ocean we
Just keep on flicking through the stations 'cause
If we don't post it does it happen
Oh I wanna be free of this

Have you and I been sleepwalking way too long
Won't someone pour ice water on me

It only matters if we care now
If you're way beyond that
And I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders
And I remember when we cared now
If you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders, my shoulders

Movies and news on television
Sometimes it's hard to tell the differences oh
When real life's more fucked up than fiction
Do you wanna be free of this?

Have you and I been sleepwalking way too long
Won't someone pour ice water on me

It only matters if we care now
If you're way beyond that
And I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders
And I remember when we cared now
If you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders

I don't wanna play dumb anymore
I just wanna feel something like before
I don't wanna feel numb anymore
I just wanna something like before

It only matters if we care now
If you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders
And I remember when we cared now
If you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders, my shoulders

""Television shoulders have the choice of watching the tragedy
Play out from the seating and comfort of their living rooms
But victims have to respond to the pressure of the media while still in shock""

If you're way beyond that
I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders, my shoulders"
110,rolling blackouts coastal fever,"Yeah we were halfway off the farm
Set back
Bank loan blowing out
Red flag in the yard
All the burnt kerosene
And the time in between
The light chit chat in the dark

You were sitting on a chair
Pretty girl with no hair
And your nine mile stare yeah
And you said, ""All the paintings
Are losing all their colour
Darling do you wanna
Take them all down
To the ground?""

And was it Jenny
Or was it Annie
Or was it Lily
That changed your point of view?
Your pretty face is curling up in anger
Just keep in mind, my darling
I did it all for you
And I was sitting in my lair
Working on my stare
Trying to make our dreams come true
And I wonder what's the use
When you're pointing at that noose
And you're looking at me
That way
Okay

Long night
Half right
Get straight
Talk it out

Long night
Half right
Get straight
Help me

Shit shit
Shit shit
Shit shit shit"
